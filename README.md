**Hey guys, this is a full website for fivem servers i made today. Everything is controlled through database.**

**Make sure to change the following in** `config.lua`

```

// MYSQL Database Details //

$host = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
$dbName = "website";

$ip = "your ip";
$port = "your port";
$max_slots = "64";
```



The website has an advanced slider that contains 3 sliders with hanging images, cool transitions and more.

It also has a server status section which shows if the server is online or offline with two different colors that switches depending on the status if it's online or offline. It also shows online players.
