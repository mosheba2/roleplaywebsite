**Hey guys, this is a full website for fivem servers i made today. Everything is controlled through database. The website supports [fontawsome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons.**

**Make sure to change the following in** `config.lua`

```

// MYSQL Database Details //

$host = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
$dbName = "website";

$ip = "your ip";
$port = "your port";
$max_slots = "64";
```



The website has an advanced slider that contains 3 sliders with hanging images, cool transitions and more.

It also has a server status section which shows if the server is online or offline with two different colors that switches depending on the status if it's online or offline. It also shows online players.

Here is a [DEMO](https://90sroleplay.com/) of the website (server status is not included in this demo)

**Installation:**

It's pretty simple, if you want to test the website out just open cmd, cd to the website directory and type the following: `php -S localhost:30` or any other port.

=====================
Have a host?

Upload the website to your public_html folder, run website.sql and make sure to change settings in `config.php` and database.

==============================
I made the website pretty fast so you might run into issues or might not. If you do or have any questions on how to set it up just give me a dm on discord **1Mosheba#8894**
